## **To Do:** ##

* Create summary method for gevrFit and gpdFit objects

* Add Moran's and Northrop's score test (for GPD)

* Add sequential threshold parameter plot

* Update all other functions with 'nzsh' function to handle shape close to zero

* Add expected covariance matrix for probability weighted moments estimation in GEV1 case

* Make sure likelihood density function is being referred to in all functions

* Add more examples and descriptions, update vignette

* Incorporate non-stationarity into the fitting and PB/ED tests
