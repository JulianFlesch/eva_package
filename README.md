## **To Do:** ##

* Incorporate non-stationarity into the fitting

* Add Moran's and Northrop's score test (for GPD)

* Add AD / CVM tests for GEV1, similar to GPD

* Add sequential threshold parameter plot

* Add expected covariance matrix for probability weighted moments estimation in GEV1 case

* Update all other functions with 'nzsh' function to handle shape close to zero. Make sure likelihood density function is being referred to in all functions. (So far gone through up to gpdFunctions.R)

* Add more examples and descriptions, update vignette
